These images were generated with HiddenLayerWireTapper.java.
For hidden_layer_N.png, the image contains the top 900 inputs
that hidden layer node N fired strongest for.  So by looking
at them you can (try) to develop an intuition for what "feature"
each hidden node is detecting.  Many of the mosaics look
random but a few have very strong patterns (e.g. 11 and 16)
